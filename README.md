# etch-a-sketch
[Live Demo](https://faithd186.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/)

Web-based etch-a-sketch game built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. To draw on the sketchpad, hover over the grid. Features include random color picker, eraser function, and black pen function. CSS grid and flexbox was used to create the layout for the game. This project showcased advanced DOM manipulation and events, and deepened my knowledge of Javascript fundamentals.
